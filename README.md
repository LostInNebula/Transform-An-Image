# Transform-An-Image
A program that transforms a bmp.file! pretty sweet, huh?

This program takes in a bmp.file and returns an altered version of the image. There are several different alterations: invert, grayscale, mirror, and rightdiff.
Invert inverts the image, grayscale turns the image into grayscale, mirror mirrors the image, and rightdiff highlights the sharp edges of the image.
Any other function in this file was not written by me, and instead 2 examples and the functions that turn the bmp.file into a matrix provided by the professor. 
To start run `python transform-an-image.py` and enter your choice of alteration, followed by the file name (ex: rightdiff(weddingphotos.bmp).

This was made as an assignment for my computer science class
